/**
 * Helix's rotating examples: a field shows a realistic example that changes
 * every few seconds while it is empty, instead of one frozen sample. Helix
 * learned three things about how, and they are kept:
 *
 * 1. One module-level beat. A screen with three fields on three timers
 *    changed them at three moments, which reads as twitching rather than as
 *    one set of examples refreshing.
 * 2. No timer while nothing shows a sample. A field with a value draws no
 *    placeholder, and a tick into a filled form re-rendered it for nothing;
 *    `active` says when the sample is visible, and the clock stops with the
 *    last field to go quiet.
 * 3. Reduced motion holds the sample still: text changing on its own is the
 *    movement that setting exists to stop.
