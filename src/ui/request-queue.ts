/**
 * One-at-a-time request queue for the promise-based overlays, Helix's.
 *
 * `appError` and `appPrompt` hand a `resolve` to a store and await it, so a
 * store that keeps a SINGLE slot loses a promise as soon as two requests
 * overlap: the second overwrites `current`, the first `resolve` is dropped, and
 * its `await` never settles. Helix hung a re-auth flow that way.
 *
 * The reducer lives here, outside the component file, for one reason: `dialog.tsx`
 * imports react-native and cannot be loaded by vitest, so the logic could only be
 * covered by a copy of itself in the test. Two hosts plus a test copy is three
 * places for the same four lines to drift; this is the one place.
