 * The write layer, Helix's (`src/db/mutations.ts`). Every write goes through

 *
 * Where it departs: Helix stamps every row with the signed-in `user_id` and
 * refuses to overwrite another account's row. A Gital device holds one
 * account's rows, the push stamps the person on a personal row, and the
